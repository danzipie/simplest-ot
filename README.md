Implementation of Chou-Orlandi Oblivious Transfer (OT) protocol

## Work in progress

A n-out-of-1 OT protocol practical implementation in Rust, as thin as possible.
The implementation is a work in progress and incomplete, not to be used in production environments. The sole purpose is to learn how to use Rust crypto libraries.

## Quickstart

This command will run an example:

```
cargo run
```
